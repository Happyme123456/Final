	          <p class="story">I play more PvP games rather than Co-Op games because I just enjoy more PvP games commonly they arer like cod so like Rainbow six siege. I like to play Rainbow Six siege when I can play with friends because it is always more fun with friends. I do play single player games like Madden,NHL,and MLB The Show. I do play car games but thats just because of the cars and racing. I play Forza sometimes not as much as I used to but I still play it for fun.</p>
